				<p>We may terminate or suspend your account and bar access to Service immediately, without prior notice or

				<p>Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those

					will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service and
					supersede
					and replace any prior agreements we might have had between us regarding Service.</p>

				<p>21. <b>Waiver And Severability</b></p>

				<p>If any provision of Terms is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid,
					illegal or
					unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such
